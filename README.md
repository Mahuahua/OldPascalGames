A few games written in Pascal at age 11.

888 is a slot machine sort of game and it is designed for the player to win....
Back in age 11 or 12, my English was terrible....(now is still the same)
Getting 8, double or triple wins money while getting 4 loses.
Accumulate enough money to advance to four digit slot machine.


The Fight takes in two names (strings) and generate stats (hp, attack, defense, luck, etc) based on the string. And two players begin to fight each other (no UI).
To make it non-determineistic, many random variables are added. For example, chances of curse the other player, restore self hp. To make it even more non-determineistic, a random variable called rp, which is indenpendent on input, is assigned to each player to further effect thier luck. (RP is a non-formal translation of luck in Chinese.)
This sort of game was very popular around that time in my environment.


Eat Apple is a game to gain score by collecting falling valuable items and to survive by avoiding bombs and debuffs falling from the sky.
Rendering the game UI in free pascal is really funny as they are super slow.
Check out different items (and both UI and gameplay "effects") by playing it!
(Reminder: Any eye damage due to playing is not my fault!)


V-I is a game similar to Raiden, but worse. Player would be able to shot regular bullets, vertical line clearance bombs, horizontal line clearance bombs and screen clearance nukes. Player bullets can cancel eremy bullets. When certain score is gained, player advence to next level with a huge wave of enemies.
